# Vex: a modern framework

Vex makes it easy to quickly setup an expressjs app with authentication and a database.

It makes use of TailwindCSS for styling and handlebars for the templating engine.

Vex tries to have an easy starting point for your application, while also getting out of the way of any extensions.

## Installation
Just run npm install:

`npm install`

Then, copy the .env.example to .env and fill in the details.

Lastly, generate the database:

`npm run generate`

## Running
The dev script compiles the css and TS and runs the webserver:

`npm run dev`
